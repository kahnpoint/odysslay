BOOK I

Listen up, fam, to this epic tale, 
Of a fly protagonist who didn't fail. 
He roamed around the globe, traveled far and wide, 
After defeating Troy, he had no place to hide. 

He saw many cities, and learned diverse customs, 
He suffered on the sea, with storms and tempests. 
Despite his attempts, he couldn't save his crew, 
Those silly sailors met their own doom, that is true. 

They ate the cattle of the Sun-god, oh no! 
Which prevented them from returning home, yo. 
Tell us, daughter of Jove, and spill the tea, 
From whatever source you know, girl, we're all ears, you see.

Listen up, fam, let me tell you 'bout Ulysses,
He's been through it all, avoided death and diseases.
He longed to see his wife again and go back to his throne,
But Calypso had him trapped in her home zone.

Years passed by, but the gods didn't forget,
It was finally time for Ulysses to jet-set.
But even in Ithaca, his troubles didn't end,
Neptune was still hating and wouldn't be his friend.

The gods had pity, they felt his pain,
But Neptune was still holding a grudge, it's insane!
Ulysses just wanted to see his queen,
But Neptune's anger made the journey obscene.

This hero's journey wasn't easy, we know,
But with perseverance, he'll overcome every foe.
Stay strong like Ulysses, don't give up hope,
And you'll make it to the top of the slope.

Yo gods, it's time to convene,
Olympus vibe check, let's convene.
Neptune's partying with the Ethiopians,
Chilling with a hecatomb of sheep and oxen.
But let's talk about Aegisthus' fate,
That dude was slayed by Orestes, no debate.
So what's our plan, how should we proceed,
To make sure justice has been achieved?

Yo, yo, yo just listen to Zeus's words flow,
He says men blame gods when they don't know,
Like Aegisthus, who thought he was hot stuff,
Tried to get with Agamemnon's wife and it got rough.

Despite Mercury's warning, the dude didn't give a care,
And now he's dead, man, Orestes got his fair share,
Zeus gave this warning out of pure kindness,
But Aegisthus ignored it, and now he's gone blindless. 

So let's not play the blame game with the divine,
Sometimes humans mess up, it's just time to shine,
And remember to always listen to advice that's true,
Or else we'll end up like Aegisthus too. #RIP #ListenToAdvice #GodsKnowBest

"Yo, Minerva, you're right on the spot
Ulysses has gone through a lot
On a lonely island, without his bros
Tired of life, longing for his own abode 

A goddess lives there, daughter of Atlas
Her charms are something he can't outlast
She's trying to make him forget his home
But Ulysses can't stop, will never succumb 

Oh, Zeus, hear my plea, what's up with the hate?
Remember the sacrifices he did to propitiate
Let go of your wrath, give him a break
It's time to end this salty lake"

Yo, Jove!

Did you forget about Ulysses, the Capable Man?

The one who's always sacrificing, doing what he can?

I know Neptune's mad he made Polyphemus blind,

But keeping him from home seems a little unkind.

Let's come together, brainstorm some dope plans,

With all of us united, Neptune won't stand a chance.

We'll get Ulysses back, no need to fear,

And maybe even drop some offerings at his feet, with cheer.

Like, Minerva was all, "Zeus's spawn, mighty ruler of all, if the gods wanna get Ulysses home, we need to give Calypso a phone call. But first, lemme head to Ithaca and give Telemachus a hype, so he can call a meeting and speak out against Penelope's unfaithful griping gripe. Those suitors be eating our boy's sheep and cattle, but we'll send them packing like Seattle without a title! We'll go to Sparta and Pylos to hear if there's any news, about the arrival of Ulysses, and maybe some island booze."

Hold up, let me tell you a tale,
'Bout a goddess that flew without fail.
Athena with her flashy kicks on,
Zoomed down to earth in a flash - gone!

Wielding her spear that's heavy-duty,
Fierce and fierce, so strong and mighty.
She landed in Odysseus' town,
Disguised as Mentes, lookin' around.

Inside the house, the suitors cozied,
Playing games, quite uncomposed and frozen.
The servants were busy, pristine and neat,
Tables cleaned up, meat cut into little bits to eat.

Goddess Athena, she was quick to act,
Ready to bring these suitors back.
Stay tuned to see how she does it,
I promise this story won't make you spit!

Telemachus was chilling with the crew
Thinking 'bout his dad and what he'd do
He saw Minerva and thought "oh shoot"
Didn't want her waiting, looking cute
He took her hand and asked for her spear
"Welcome to our crib, we got noms here"
After you've eaten, let us know
Why you're here, what's the flow?

As he walked and talked, Minerva came along,
He took her spear and placed it in a throng,
Of spears, which belonged to his sorrowful father,
And led her to a seat, grander than any other.

With a cloth of damask, he covered her chair,
And provided a footstool for her feet to bear,
The noise of suitors he kept far away,
So she could eat in peace and he could say:

"More about my father I need to know,
Share with me goddess, don't be slow,
Their insolence won't irritate you here,
Tell me the truth, don't let your words disappear." 

The atmosphere was peaceful, and Minerva was glad,
She told him the truth without being sad,
And as they talked, the suitors grew angry,
But Telemachus didn't care, he only felt tangy.

For he had found answers to what he sought,
Thanks to Minerva who helped him a lot,
And he knew that he was on the right track,
For he won't let his father's killers come back.

The story gets even better, let me spit some facts,
They were served on gold plates, and drank from gold cups without any lacks,
The maid, the servant, the carver, the upper,
All brought the fire, we love to see them show their power.

Their water was served in a golden ewer and silver basin,
I'm beyond shook, let me tell you that for certain,
The carver did them justice with all manner of meat,
I wish I was there, those plates must have looked real neat.

And let's not forget about the wine that was poured,
By a man-servant, who knew how to keep it stored,
I would give anything to party with these guys,
Raise a glass and say cheers, until the sun starts to rise.

Yo, the suitors are here, taking their seats,
Men servants pour water, maids with bread like it's beats.
Pages fill mixing bowls, let the wine flow,
Hands on the good things, let's go with the flow.
Eating and drinking, they want more,
Music and dancing, like never before.
A servant brought a lyre, to Phemius' delight,
And the suitors compelled him to sing with all their might.
As soon as he begins, Telemachus whispers low,
To Minerva, so no man can hear, don't you know.

Yo dude, don't get mad, but I gotta hype this chat.
Singing's dope, but not if it's at the cost of a dead man's bat.
If these dudes saw your dad, they'd wish for longer legs.
Money ain't what they want, they just care about their kegs.
But, alas, your dad's fate was cruel and grim.
Folks say he's coming back, but we know that's slim.
Bro, gimme the deets, who you are is what I seek.
Where ya from? How'd you get here? Spill it! Don't be meek.
What's your crew and ship like, and what's your background be?
Have you been here before, or are you new like a Wii?

Yo, listen up and hear me tell,
a story that I know quite well.
Mentes is the name I bear,
King of Taphians without a care.

My ship and crew, we set to sail,
To Temesa with cargo and mail.
Iron we bring and copper we take,
While we navigate sea and lake.

My ship is docked in that harbor yonder,
Near the mountain with trees asunder.
Our fathers were friends, like buds on a tree,
Old Laertes knows, just ask and you'll see.

They tell me, your dad's not in this town,
But instead kept from you by a heavenly crown.
He's not dead yet or trapped on land,
Somewhere, he must be or in a foreign band.

I'm no prophet, but hear me out,
Ulysses will return, there's no doubt.
He's a man of resourceful might,
Chains can't hold him, he'll take flight.

Now, tell me true, my curious fella,
Can Ulysses have a boy that's so hella?
You look like him, no doubt at all,
Both Argives, both standing tall.

Since Troy fell, for ages long,
Neither have seen each other gone.
But here we are, face to face,
And maybe soon, in the same place.

Yo, my dude Telemachus in the house,
Wishing for a dad who's not stuck like a mouse,
His mother says his pops is the mighty Ulysses,
But he's not sure who that is and he confesses.

He wishes for a dad with a simpler life,
Someone who's not always stuck in strife,
Being a son of Ulysses is tough,
His dad's reputation is just too rough.

Telemachus longs for a family like his friends,
One that's not brimming with endless trends,
He wants a dad who's always there,
Not one who's always on a dare.

But who knows, maybe things will change,
And his father's love will be in range,
Until then, our boy's feeling blue,
Just like the meme says, "Feels bad, man," it's true.

Yo, Minerva my girl, don't you know?
Telemachus' swag is off the charts, yo!
As for the feast, it's lit, it's live,
The homies came to party and thrive.

No wedding bells or food for show,
Those guests came to drink and go with the flow,
But you're right, they actin' like fools,
Disrespecting the house and breaking the rules.

Telemachus knows it's not cool,
But he's gotta keep his cool, he's no fool,
He needs to find his pa,
Who's been gone for way too long, raw.

So don't stress, Minerva my queen,
Telemachus is focused, he's not mean,
He'll handle these guests with class,
And find his father, he'll kick ass!

"Bro," said Telmachus, "let me explain,
My dad's disappearance caused us all pain.
The gods, in their wrath, made him vanish real quick,
Without leaving a trace, it makes me feel sick.
If he had died in Troy, it would've been okay,
And his fame would have lived on every day.
But now it's all lost, I inherit dismay,
And I don't know how to fix it, what can I say?
But wait, there's more, my house is a mess,
People eating my food without any finesse.
The chiefs from all islands, they're causing distress,
My mother won't marry, but won't say no unless.
They're taking my stuff, ruining my life,
It's all getting too much, causing strife."

Oh dang, so you're telling me, 
Ulysses needs his gear, his weaponry. 
If he's still the same guy I used to know, 
He'll take down those suitors, he'll put on a show.
Back then, he headed to Ephyra, 
Begged Ilus for poison to make his arrows fly higher. 
Ilus didn't want to mess with the gods above, 
But my dad gave Ulysses some, he had much love.
If he's as great as before, those suitors won't last, 
Their wedding plans are doomed, it's a thing of the past.

Lit fam, heaven decides if he'll go back,
And take revenge on the suitors who lack.
But trust me, you gotta act fast,
Call an assembly and lay it out in contrast.

Let the Achaean heroes know your pain,
And bid the suitors to leave their vain.
If your mom wants to get hitched again,
Send her back to her father, let him entertain.

You, sir, must gather a crew,
Of twenty men, and set sail anew.
In search of your long-lost dad,
Who may be alive, you'll be glad.

Go to Pylos, ask Nestor first,
Then hit up Sparta, quench that thirst.
If dad's alive, deal with those suitors,
For another year, they'll have to be troopers.

But if he's dead, come home and bury,
And build a barrow, don't worry.
Then think of ways to kill the suitors,
Make a name for yourself in future rumors.

You're no baby, can't play that card,
Remember Orestes, praise was his award.
So, go and kill those suitors in your own house,
Impress your kin and be feared by your spouse.

I gotta go, my crew's waiting,
But think over what I'm stating.
Take care and good luck to you,
May the gods help you all the way through.

Yo, Telemachus, you're hella chill,
Treating me like your pops, it's a thrill.
You're kind to tell me all you know,
And I'll hear more before I go.

But wait a sec, don't bounce so fast,
Refresh yo'self, it'll be a blast.
Take a bath, relax and chill,
I'll give you a gift that's ill.

So listen up, my dear friend,
This present's off the charts 'till the end.
It's beauty and value ain't no joke,
A keepsake that'll leave ya stoked.

Yo Minerva, you're a goddess no doubt, 
On your way out, of this place you flout, 
Don't keep her here, she needs to depart, 
But keep the present, till she's back at the start.

You know this girl, she's got some class, 
So give her presents that will surpass, 
Her expectations, give something great, 
And in return, she'll appreciate.

She's a legend, she's so divine,
Her presence here, such a sign,
So give her something, to make her stay, 
And she'll give back in every way.

Oh dang, Telemachus is on a roll,  
Feeling brave and in control.  
He saw a god, some may call it fate,  
And now he's marching towards the haters' gate. 

The suitors were chilling, eating and drinking,  
Their party was loud, but soon they'd be shrinking.  
Telemachus walked in, looking hella fly,  
Showing off his newfound strength and his battle cry. 

The suitors were shook, they didn't know what to do,  
They never expected this dude to come through.  
Telemachus stood tall, with his head held high,  
And he said, "You'll all pay for making my household cry!" 

The suitors were weak, but they tried to fight back,  
Don't they know Telemachus is on the right track?  
He's got the gods on his side, and now he's got guts,  
With his mentor Athena and his pops up above. 

Telemachus is a boss, he won't back down,  
The suitors better run or they'll be put down.  
Thanks to the goddess, his courage now bloomed,  
And he'll show those losers he can't be outdoomed.

Yo, Phemius spittin' bars, 
Tales of Troy straight from the stars, 
Penelope hearin', tears in her eyes, 
Her handmaids steady as they realize. 

She comes down the stairs with grace, 
Surrounded by beauty, full of grace, 
Veil on her face, hidin' her tears, 
Upset by the song and all its fears. 

The suitors watch as she makes her way, 
One bearing post, she stands to say, 
Why bring sorrow to my heart so true, 
Icarius' daughter, at a loss to do. 

Phemius droppin' rhymes and beats, 
Penelope hearin', feelin' the heat, 
Her heart is shattered, her soul torn apart, 
As the melody lingers in her heart. 

She weeps for the Achaeans and their fate, 
Her tears dropping like a heavy weight, 
But her spirit's strong, she won't back down, 
Filled with determination, she wears her crown.

Yo Phemius, stop with that depressing scheme
Instead, spit some fire 'bout some lit godly dream
Tell the suitors 'bout some epic quest
And let them drink and vibe, feeling their best

Your tales of sorrow only make me blue
Reminding me of my lost dude, who
Was loved by all in middle Argos
His name reaching heights of venerated cosmos

But don't forget, we need some lituation
A story that sparks joy, not consternation
So come on, Phemius, let's hear your flow
Take us to a world where legends grow

Like the Greek gods that reign supreme
A tale that's dope, a story we can dream
So crack open that bottle and let's get lit
Phemius, you got this, go on and spit!

Oh, snap, Telemachus was getting heated,
His mom didn't like the bard's tune, but he repeated,
"Chill, ma, the bards don't create the chaos they sing,
It's all about the big guy, Jove, doing his thing."

Telemachus was real smooth, no need to fuss,
He knew that people dug the latest songs, like it's a must,
So don't worry, ma, just accept the news,
Ulysses ain't the only one who didn't get to choose.

Head back inside and do what you do,
The loom and distaff and running the crew,
Because talking's for men, that's what he said,
Especially for him, master here, in charge ahead.

Oh dang, Penelope's heart is aching
Her son's words, in her mind, constantly shaking
Her husband, gone for so long
Her tears fall, like a sad love song

Upstairs, she weeps with her girls
Mourning her loss, in a sad swirl
But Minerva, the goddess, brings relief
And Penelope sleeps, with a sense of belief

Meanwhile, the suitors make lots of noise
Trying to get Penelope, the ultimate prize
They beg and plead, for a chance to be with her
But little do they know, that Penelope's heart is a blur.

"Yo Telemachus, your words are on point,
But these suitors ain't got no joint,
Feasting and acting so lavish,
But can't even leave, that's straight savage.

Phemius' voice is divine, it's true,
But what's with this squabbling, boo-hoo?
Tomorrow in the morning, full assembly planned,
So get outta here, that's the command.

Turn and turn about, feast at your own cost,
Otherwise, Jove's reckoning, there'll be a high cost,
If you fall in my father's house, no one to save,
So hop to it, and leave, no need to misbehave."

Oh snap, Antinous, don't you see,
This dude's got a gift, listen to me!
His speech is bold, his confidence high,
Don't hate on him just 'cause you can't even try.

You talk about gods, but have no chill,
You should take some lessons, maybe pop a pill.
This guy's got swag, he's got the moves,
Don't be jelly, it won't improve.

His dad was chief, that's for sure,
But this dude's got skills, you can't ignore.
So don't be hating, just give him a chance,
He might surprise you with his stance. 

#SorryNotSorry #HatersGonnaHate #SwaggyMcSwagger

Antinous, bro, stop hating on me
I'll be chief, just wait and see 
Is that really the worst you can do? 
Being chief brings riches and honour too 

Yeah, Ulysses is gone, that's true 
But Ithaca has many great men, not just a few 
I may not lead them all, that's fine 
But in my own house, I'll be the one to shine 

The people Ulysses won for me 
Will be mine to rule, just you wait and see 
So don't trip, don't worry, don't stress 
I'll hold it down, I'll be the best 

*drops mic*

Eury! You're up with your words so sly!
It's not up to you to decide who's the guy,
But we'll listen to you, Odysseus, dude so fly,
You're the master of your own house, that ain't a lie!

This stranger that we see, tell us about his game,
Where does he come from? What is his fame?
Is he here to make some quick dough or name?
Did you hear news from him? Or is he just a solid frame?

He seemed rich 'n' all, but he was quick to bounce,
Before we could figure his deal and pronounce,
So Odysseus, man, won't you give us the ounce,
'Bout this stranger who left us in a hurry and pounce?

Yo, my dude Telemachus spittin' facts,
His pops is gone, and he ain't goin' back.
Mama's checkin' with a soothsayer,
But Telemachus ain't got time for that player.

He met a stranger named Mentes,
Son of Anchialus, chief of Taphians.
He seemed familiar, but he couldn't place it,
In his heart, he knew it was the goddess.
 
Telemachus ain't trustin' rumors no more,
He's ready to even the score,
If anyone's been messin' with his fam,
He'll make 'em pay, oh damn. 

But for now, he's just chillin' with Mentes,
Ponderin' about the gods and their intents.
Greece ain't ready for this young king's rise,
He's gonna make 'em all reprise. 

#Nohashtags #Rhyminggamestrong #Telemachuskeepingitreal

Telemachus was chillin' in his tower,
Brooding and thinking hour by hour,
With Euryclea, by his side,
He had nothing to hide.

She held the torch high and lit the way,
As Telemachus had much to say,
Laertes' son was in deep thought,
While the old woman's care had him caught.

He sat on the bed, took off his shirt,
And handed it to her without any hurt,
She hung it nicely, he laid down,
Thinking of his journey, with a little frown.

The advice of the goddess, Minerva in his head,
Knowing what he must do instead,
All night long he kept on thinking,
As his mind was quickly shrinking.

Aight, check it out, let me tell you a tale
That's gonna be hype, it's gonna prevail
It's got memes, slang, and all that jazz
It's gonna be fire, no need for pizzazz

The story starts with a queen, a true boss
She ran the game, she was never at a loss
Her drip was tight, her fit was clean
She was the queen of the scene, if you know what I mean

But then one day, some drama went down
Her haters came out, they tried to take the crown
But she wasn't phased, she stood her ground
And in the end, she snatched that crown without a sound

The haters were shook and they knew they lost
They couldn't handle the queen, at any cost
She slayed with grace, she slayed with might
She showed them all what it means to be tight

So now the queen reigns supreme
She's got the throne, she's living the dream
Her story's lit, it's one for the ages
And you know what? It's got all the rage-ous.

BOOK II

Telemachus be lookin' like a god, no lie,
Fly kicks, sword shinin', he's catchin' the eye.
He calls his homies with the criers' sound,
And they gather round in the meeting ground.

Two hounds by his side, he walks with swag,
The way he looks, it makes the people gag.
Minerva's gift, a presence so divine,
That even old councillors make way like they're in line.

In his father's seat, he takes his rightful place,
Everyone's lookin', they can't keep their gaze.
Telemachus, young and bold,
Ready to hear what the people hold.

He's not just a boy, he's not just a man,
He's got the charm that only gods can.
Telemachus, smart and slick,
He could lead an army, do it quick!

No wonder Minerva blessed him right,
Telemachus would put up a good fight.
He's got it all, style and grace,
Telemachus, he's holdin' the ace.

Yo, listen up, this is a tale 'bout Aegyptius,
Old school guy, but his words are never bogus.
He'd been around the block, with infinite experience,
But his heart was still shattered with immense grievance.

His son Antiphus went with Ulysses to Ilius,
With noble horses and warriors who weren't clueless.
But Cyclops got them all in a cave locked,
Poor Antiphus, by the Cyclops was cooked.

Three sons he had, but only one was a suitor,
Eurynomus, who Aegyptius thought was a hater.
The other two worked hard for their dad,
While he couldn't get over Antiphus being dead.

Aegyptius’ heart was still filled with sorrow,
For the loss of his son today and tomorrow.
But he spoke with wisdom, in spite of his pain,
And forever he will remember his lost son's name.

Hey all you men of Ithaca, let's hear it out
It's been so long since we had a council meet about
Who's this guy trying to call us together, no doubt?
Is he warning us of danger or got some other clout?
He seems like a solid dude, hope he gets good clout
May Jove bless his desires, no naysayers to flout.

Yo, Telemachus took the speech,
As a signal to speak to the whole reach.
He gathered everyone around,
And his coolness could be easily found.

The good herald Pisenor brought his staff,
And Telemachus was ready to laugh,
"Not warning of any hater,
But I'm aggrieved, it's a personal matter."

He said, "The loss of my father is the first,
And it's the second that is the worst.
My mother's suitors are a pain,
Ruining our estate, it's not a gain.

The chief men's sons are in my house,
Marrying my mom like it's a mouse,
Afraid to ask my grandpa for bride,
Every day, I can't hide.

Sacrificing our oxen, sheep,
Drinking wine like it's a treat,
Our estate will be in ruins,
No more Ulysses for the actions of these goons.

I can't stand this any longer,
I used to be stronger,
House disgraced and ruined,
You can't keep us dampened.

So, don't leave me singlehanded,
Or my brave father, who you once demanded,
Did he do wrong to the Achaeans in the past,
That you would make me eat it at last?

If you eat out of house and home,
I'd rather you get eaten to the bone,
So I can take action to the extreme,
And won't have just to dream."

By Jove and Themis, he made his case,
Hoping they won't leave it like usual, without any trace.
Telemachus poised and ready,
Like cup noodles, always steady.

Telemachus poured his heart out, his sadness so loud,
His staff hit the ground, tears wetting the crowd.
Everyone felt for him, but stayed quiet still,
Except Antinous, who just had to be shrill.

"Bro, why all the tears? You're being so extra,
Can't you see we're chillin', with no need for this nectar?"
Telemachus felt anger, he was about to snap,
But he breathed and composed himself like a true rap.

"Antinous, you're just a hater, always bringing drama,
Can't you see I'm struggling, you're just adding trauma?
But mark my words, I won't let you bring me down,
I'll find my father, and bring justice to this town."

The room fell silent, as Telemachus spoke with power,
Antinous stood defeated, his ego lost in the hour.
From this moment on, Telemachus showed his true grit,
A hero in the making, who won't ever quit.

Oh snap, Telemachus should definitely have a seat
He's out here pointing fingers, placing all the blame on our feet
Saying it's the suitors' fault, but let me tell you this,
It's your mom who's the real mastermind, making us all miss

For three years now, and almost reaching four,
She's had us going crazy, knocking at her door
Playing mind games, sending mixed messages,
Making us believe she's down for some courtly marriages

And let's not forget her needlework, so intricate and grand
Trying to make us wait for love, she's got us caught up in her plan
Crafting a pall for Laertes, sweat dripping from her brow,
She wants him to have a rich burial, with women gossiping "wow"

So don't come at us, Telemachus, with all your insolence,
Your mom's got skills, she's the one who's been making all this sense
Now let's all just chill, take a break and exhale,
And see where this Odyssey story goes, as we set sail. 

#NoHashtags #NotYoUsualText #LitRhymes

Okay, listen up, y'all, I got a story to tell,  
Bout a woman who knew magic, spun a web pretty well.  
She fooled everyone for three years, a real sly trick,  
Workin' all day, unpickin' at night with her torch lit.  

But in the fourth year, one maid spilled the tea,  
Told her captors what was up, set the truth free.  
They caught her red-handed, and said, "enough's enough,  
Mama's gotta go, find a husband, that's the tough stuff."  

These suitors couldn't handle her smarts and her skill,  
Her airs and accomplishments makin' them ill.  
They wanted her gone so they could have some peace,  
Their gluttony hurtin' her son's estate, sheesh.  

They'd heard of legendary women, Tyro and such,  
But Mama was the real deal, they couldn't keep up.  
They wouldn't leave until Mama said, "I do,"  
Heard enough of her excuses, they wanted someone who  

Wouldn't toy with their hearts, or mess with their minds,  
Someone who'd submit and be less hard to find.  
So that's the story, folks, of Mama the Queen,  
Pretending to weave, but really causing a scene.

Antinous, dude, what's your deal?
Don't you know how I feel?
My dad's gone, we don't know where
My heart's heavy but you just don't care

I can't send my mom away 
and it's not something I can just say 
If I do, I'll have to pay
And I'll regret it every day

Icarius wants a hefty sum
If we send his daughter home,
It's not just that, it's also dumb
And my conscience will forever moan

If you're mad, just leave instead
Go feast elsewhere, break bread
But if you keep being a freeloader
Jove will be your debtor, shoulder to shoulder

In my father's house, you won't stand
No one will avenge you, I won't lend a hand
So think twice before you sponge
On the hospitality that's already been avenged.

Yo, peeps, let me tell you 'bout a vision,
Jove sent two eagles, not just a revision.
They flew with the wind, side by side,
Sailing like bosses, oh what a ride!

As they reached the assembly, they wheeled and circled,
Beating their wings, their eyes glaring, oh how they sparkled!
They fought fiercely, tearing one another apart,
Then flew off towards the town, like a work of art.

People wondered, what could this mean?
Halitherses spoke up, like a prophetic machine.
He said, "Listen up, I speak honesty,
This vision is a message, can't you see?"

These eagles represent a powerful force,
Two sides fighting, a conflict of course.
They'll bring death and destruction, no doubt,
So let's prepare, before chaos breaks out."

Yo, dudes of Ithaca, let me spit some truth
This warning is mainly for the sleuths;
There's trouble brewing and it's not mild,
Ulysses is coming back to execute his style.

He'll rain down chaos, don't think he's bluffin',
Not just on the suitors, but on all of us nothin's,
We need to act fast and smart, before things get rough,
Otherwise, we'll experience some pretty gnarly stuff.

The suitors should stop this shit on their own,
Otherwise, they'll end up burying their bones,
I'm not just talkin' without reason,
I predicted Ulysses' fate before he left, so hear me, son.

I said that he'd lose all his men and face pain,
And then, after twenty years, he'd return to his domain,
But nobody would recognize him, his face obscured,
And now it's all happening as I foresaw, you heard?

So heed my wise words and stop the madness,
Or face the wrath of this hero's badassness.

Hold up, Grandpa, what's with the fuss?
Your omen skills are weak, never trust a bird to discuss.
Ulysses is gone, no need to weep,
But you need to chill, your words are too deep.

Trying to rile up Telemachus with your speech,
But we won't let you teach.
Your words are just a game,
We see through you like it's nothing but lame.

I mean, come on, seriously,
You think you know more than us so clearly?
We won't pay, we'll just keep eating,
Telemachus's food we'll be beating.

Your advice, we won't heed,
Our girl Penelope is all we need.
We'll stay and make ourselves at home while we can,
But honestly, you should leave, man.

Go home, old-timer, and take a nap,
'Cause right now, you're just a trap.
Don't try to play us like you're the boss,
We see through you like a transparent gloss.

So go on, go back to your fam,
We're all good here, ya hearin' the jam?
And if you decide to stay and linger,
We'll just have to take your finger. (LOL just kidding)

Oh snap, you hear that, suitors and crew? 
Telemachus is not playing, he's not pulling a boo-hoo. 
He's got some serious business to attend, 
Trying to find the man he calls his friend. 

He needs a ship and some of you to steer, 
Twenty strong men, to find his daddy dear. 
He'll go to Sparta and Pylos too, 
Searching everywhere, just to find a clue. 

Maybe he'll hear something, or get a sign, 
Letting him know where his dad might dine. 
If he's alive and on his way back, 
Telemachus will let you all continue to pack. 

But if he's dead and gone forever, 
Telemachus will mourn, no doubt, whatever. 
He'll bury his father with utmost prestige, 
And make his mom happy, that's for sure, he'll besiege.

Yo! It's time to hear what's up from Mentor,
He's got the truth, he's not a dissenter.
As Ulysses' friend, he's got full authority,
So let's hear him out, and feel the solidarity.

He spoke with honesty, no need to lie,
Here's the 411, so don't be shy.
Mentor's got the tea, so listen up tight,
And don't let his words slip out of sight.

He said, Ulysses is gone and won't be coming back,
But don't worry y'all, we won't fall off track.
We'll hold down the fort and do what we can,
Until Ulysses returns, with his master plan. 

So, let's stay strong and hold our heads up high,
We've got this fam, no need to cry.
Mentor's got our back, let's be clear,
And with his guidance, we'll overcome our fear. 

Keep calm and carry on, is what Mentor would say,
We'll keep the house running, come what may.
So listen up now, he's done with his story,
Let's keep the faith, and keep up the glory.

Y'all hear me out, men of Ithaca town,
Your rulers are just a big-time letdown,
I hope you get rulers, who are cruel and despotic,
Who'll destroy your city, be totally chaotic.

Every single chief you choose,
Make 'em unjust, who'll make us lose.
Ulysses was the one who led,
Like a father, he had us fed.

I ain't mad at the suitors, they have every right,
But you guys are weak, can't put up a fight.
Scandalous behavior, you should stop it,
You could do it, gather and plot it.

Hold up, hold up, what is this rhyming ruckus?
Mentor, why you tryna make a scene, you can't bust us.
One man against many, that's just insane,
Ulysses himself wouldn't try to be so vain.

His wife's waiting for him, can't you see the situation?
If he fought us now, it'd be his own damnation.
So go on people, do what you gotta do,
Let's let Mentor and Halitherses see this boy through.

But let's be real, will he even make the trip?
He's more likely to stay put and give us all the slip.
So let's not get too worked up over nothing,
And let the boy decide if he wants to get running.

Oh snap, the assembly's adjourned
Everyone went home, no one too concerned 
Suitors, on the other hand, went to Ulysses' place
Thinking they could win Penelope's heart in a chase

But little did they know, Our man Ulysses was just in disguise
Ready to give them a surprise 
He'll come back and show them who's the boss
Leaving them all at a big loss

No more games, no more chasing
Those suitors need to start facing
The wrath of Ulysses, the man himself
Who's been away for years, getting help from a helpful elf.

Yo, Telemachus be feeling all-alone,
By the sea, he's thinking on his own,
Washing his hands in the grey waves,
Praying to Minerva, hoping she saves.

He be asking for guidance and power,
In this desperate, lonely hour,
He's hoping Minerva hears his plea,
And helps him unlock his true destiny.

Telemachus seeking divine intervention,
Like when you ask for likes on social media attention,
His devotion and faith is unwavering,
Like a meme going viral, forever spreading.

With his hands in the water and sand,
Telemachus puts his future in Minerva's hand,
Hoping she can be his guiding light,
Like a trending hashtag shining bright.

"Hold up, fam, I gotta speak my mind,
Zeus came through and gave me a sign,
To find my dad who's been gone so long,
But these suitors got me feeling so wrong.

They always tryna block my way,
Like, why you gotta act that way?
But I know I gotta keep my head high,
And listen to the man up in the sky.

So watch out suitors, I'm on a mission,
And I won't stop until I complete my mission,
Zeus gave me the go, so you better hide,
'Cause I'm coming through like a swift low-ride.

I gotta find my dad and bring him home,
No matter where he's been or where he's roamed,
So Zeus, hear me out, I'm on my way,
To bring my dad back home, hip hip hooray!"

Yo, Telemachus, hear me out,  
You gotta show what you're about.  
Minerva's here to give some aid,  
As Mentor, all her help displayed.  

Your father, he was wise and strong,  
And never did his duty wrong.  
If you're made of the same kind,  
Your voyage won't be left behind.  

But if you lack his courage, friend,  
Then success seems far from the end.  
Sons, they're never like their dads,  
But don't you fret, don't you be sad.  

Don't join those suitors, foolish lot,  
Who care for naught and want you not.  
Death and doom soon will befall,  
On each and every one of them all.  

Now listen up, it won't be long,  
You'll be packing your bags and gone.  
Get everything in order, quick,  
Wine in jars and barley thick.  

I'll find a ship, she'll be the best,  
And with you, I'll put it to the test.  
I'll gather volunteers to help,  
You'll thank me later for sitting kelp.  

So go ahead and head back home,  
While I go and search and roam.  
We'll meet again, don't you forget,  
We'll sail the sea without regret.  

(Insert meme reference here)

Yo, was Antinous trippin', thinking Telemachus would just stop his mission!
But Telemachus had a plan, with the help of the goddess Minerva he's stopping all opposition.
As he slid up to the party, they were cooking up some meat, Antinous came at him with a laugh and handshake, thinking he'd just take a seat.
But Telemachus was all business, he wasn't about to chill, he wanted to know about his father's whereabouts, and he won't stop until he fulfills. 
Antinous offered him a crew and a boat, thinking it's what he wanted most, 
But little did he know, Telemachus was about to roast.
He took the offer but planned to use it for his own gain, meeting new people, gaining allies, and not allowing opposition to remain.

Telemachus, bro, listen to my spiel
Your haters be trippin' and it's real
These suitors be hatin' on your wealth
But you got good health, and courage as well

They wasted your property, how dare they
But you ain't gonna take it, not today
You're older and wiser, and that's legit
You know your strength, and you won't submit

You're gonna do 'em harm, oh yeah, no doubt
Whether here with these people or goin' down south
Pylos is where you're headed, it's true
And those suitors better watch their rear view

You may not have a ship, nor a crew
But you're a passenger on a mission, you knew?
Your going won't be in vain, take that to heart
And these haters will finally depart

It's clear this Antinous is a hater, 
Trying to throw shade and stir up some cater.
But Odysseus won't have it, he's too lit, 
He snatches his hand away, doesn't give a sh*t. 

The others are just jealous, trying to clown, 
Taunting and mocking, guess they wanna bring him down. 
But Odysseus stays cool, won't get caught in their trap, 
He's a boss, nothing they say can cause a mishap. 

Dinner's getting ready, they better watch their back, 
Odysseus might come through and put 'em all in check. 
He's a hero for a reason, they shouldn't test his might, 
Or else they'll feel his wrath all through the night. 

So don't mess with the OG, the one and only, 
Odysseus is in the house and he's feeling quite lonely. 
But that's okay, he's got himself and his pride, 
And that's all a lit king needs, just let them all slide.

Oh snap, that's quite the mishap
Telemachus is on the move, better watch your back
Pylos and Sparta, he's got a plan
Maybe even Ephyra, to kill us where we stand

But don't worry fam, we won't let him win
We'll be ready for whatever he brings in
With our squad and our memes, we'll never fall
Telemachus won't get us, no way, not at all

So keep your head up and stay woke
We'll beat Telemachus in one fell stroke
And when we're done, we'll celebrate with some tea
'Cause we're the coolest crew in history!

Yo, did you hear that one dude?
Thinking Telemachus is some sort of food?
Talking 'bout dividing up his cash,
Thinking it's easy, like a game of trash.

But wait a minute, hold up a sec!
Telemachus is no one to disrespect.
He's on a journey to find his lost father,
And that's a journey we shouldn't bother.

With his mother and the man who marries her,
They can have the house, that's just how it occurs.
But Telemachus is more than just wealth,
He's a warrior, a champion, and in his family's health.

So let's not wish him harm or selfish gain,
Let him continue on his brave campaign.
We'll root for him, like a meme going viral,
And hope one day he'll come back with a smile.

"Hey Euryclea, my homey from afar, 
I need your help to inspect this treasure jar.
We need to make sure that our wealth is secure,
And that no thieves have tried to break in for sure. 

Check out the linen and clothes in these chests,
And smell that olive oil, it's one of the best!
But most importantly, our wine must be divine,
Fit for a god, can't let it go past the line. 

These doors are sturdy, to keep everything safe,
And you, Euryclea, are holding down the place.
You're the OG of this house, always on top of it,
Making sure our goods stay fresh and legit."

Yo nurse, pour me the best wine,
The one that's super fine.
Hide some for dad, in case he's alive,
And comes home to revive.

Give me twelve jars, don't be a crook,
And make sure they all have a lid you took.
Pack twenty measures of barley meal,
My trip to Sparta and Pylos I'll seal.

Do this quick and quietly,
No need to mention it to the family.
When night falls and my mom's upstairs,
I'll sneak away with my wares.

Hoping to hear some news,
Of my dad's return and end these blues.

Yo, Euryclea, don't cry, don't you weep,
It's just that his wanderlust runs deep,
Odysseus is the man of the game,
But you think his plan is totally lame.

With his genius, he survived Troy's fall,
But he misses his kingdom, I mean, I get it all,
But home is where your heart's at ease,
And with Penelope he can shoot the breeze.

But hold up, what's this talk about his dad?
He's off to find him, it's so rad,
He left him young, so he feels stuck,
But he knows his pops can bring him some luck.

And you know what they say 'bout blood,
They're thicker than a Mississippi mud,
His father's fate's gotta be unveiled,
And with Athena's help, it won't be failed.

So Euryclea, please don't you cry,
Odysseus isn't meant to die,
He's got a purpose, so let him go,
And hope that one day he'll come back, yo.

Yo nurse, don't fret
My plan's heaven-set
But pinky promise, don't spill a word
'Cuz Mom's tears can't be incurred

For ten to twelve days
Keep this secret in a maze
If Mom catches wind and asks
Then you can spill and remove your mask

Yo, let me tell you bout this lady so cute
She swore a hardcore oath that was really acute
She started pouring that vino in big ol' jars
And the barley meal was bagged up without any scars

While she worked hard, Telemachus strutted in
He sauntered back to the suitors with a confident grin
These suitors were wildin', they were all up in the place
Trying to take his momma while stuffing their face

But Telemachus knew what he had to do
He was ready to fight, his spirit shining through
He would protect his mother from all these lames
And stand up for his fam, 'cause that's just how he games

Oh dang, Minerva's got a plan
She took his shape, she's in command
She hyped up the crew, gave 'em a pep talk
They're off to sail, no time for small talk

Noemon hooked them up with a boat
Everything's set, they're ready to float 
The goddess led them to the end of the dock
Her plan's in motion, like an alarm clock 

When the sun set, they were ready to go
All the gear was packed, their spirits aglow
Minerva's plan- they're on their way
The ship's sailing off without delay 

She kept the crew pumped and hyped
Their eyes set on victory, they'll never lose sight
Minerva's skills, they'll have to suffice
With her leading them, their future is bright 

#notimeforsmalltalk #sailingsquad #settosail #motivationstation #victory #teamworkmakesdreamwork

Oh dang, Athena was on a roll
She went to Ulysses' house, to take control
Her plan to make the suitors drop
Their cups from their hands, was straight-up high on top
Those dudes were fuddled, sleepy, and blurred
Instead of partying, they went back to the herd
Then Athena, aka Mentor, gave a call
To Telemachus, so he didn't stall
It was time to come outside, oh snap!
Athena's plan was like an epic map

Oh, snap, Telemachus, don't be slow,
The guys are ready, don't you know?
They're on board and ready to row,
So hurry up, we've got places to go.

Your orders are what they need,
To set sail and get up to speed.
Don't make them wait or we'll be late,
And that would be a major hate.

So let's go, man, don't be shy,
Time's a-wastin' and we can't lie.
Our journey awaits, we cannot stall,
So give the word and let's give our all. 

And remember, as we hit the sea,
"We're all in this together," just like HSM.

Oh snap, Telemachus is on a quest,
To find his dad and put to rest,
The suitors who have overstayed,
And caused chaos where they laid.

With Athena by his side,
He heads towards the rising tide,
The crew is hyped and ready,
To set sail and keep things steady.

Telemachus gives the command,
To load the stores and take a stand,
Against those who would do them harm,
And cause chaos with their charm.

But wait, his mom is none the wiser,
To the plan that's about to rile her,
Only one maid servant in the know,
The rest will be surprised, yo!

As they set sail, they feel the power,
Of the gods in this crucial hour,
Telemachus and crew so bold,
Will find his dad and be so gold.

Yo, Telemachus is a boss,
Leading his squad to a righteous cause.
They loaded up their gear with haste,
And off they set with no time to waste.

Minerva, goddess of wisdom and such,
Took a seat and whispered, "Don't fuss too much."
As the crew set the sails with might,
A fair wind blew, oh what a sight!

They pulled the ropes, hoisted their gear,
Set the mast, and had no fear.
The ship rode the waves with skill,
And the foam splashed, like a Chili's grill.

The crew made drink offerings to the skies,
Calling to the gods with teary eyes.
The daughter of Jove received their praise,
For guiding them through these stormy days.

Oh snap, the ship's on the move,
From late night hours, it don't approve.
Speeding through the darkness so tight,
Making its way till morning light.

The sails are up, the wind is strong,
The ship is lit and nothing's wrong.
It's cruising through the sea so vast,
Going fast, faster than a TikTok dance.

From dusk till dawn, the ship does sail,
No time to waste, no time to fail.
The crew is savage, they know their stuff,
Working hard, they ain't giving up.

So if you want a story to behold,
The ship's journey is pure gold.
Filled with hype and pure delight,
This ship's journey is one to write.

What up, what up, let me put it in the mix,
Got a story that'll leave you like, "oh, shi*!"

Got a tale so epic, you won't believe your eyes,
No cap, it's gonna have you feeling hella fly.

It's like a movie, but in real time,
So massive, it's straight up prime.

We're talking 'bout drama, suspense, and mystery,
It's crazier than the Kardashian family history.

This story's got more twists than a pretzel,
It's hotter than the sauce on a Chipotle vessel.

It's gonna make you jump, scream, and shout,
Like the reaction to that Vine of that kid who's all about.

So sit back and chill, and get ready for a ride,
This story's so wicked, it's gonna be your new vibe.

BOOK III

As the sun rose high in the sky,
Telemachus and crew came nigh
To Pylos, where bulls were being sacrificed,
The people praying that Neptune be pleased and pacified.

Guilds of five hundred, nine in all,
With nine bulls burning, tall and strong and tall.
As they ate the meat and drank the wine,
Telemachus and crew arrived just in time.

They furled the sails, brought the ship to rest,
And disembarked with a feeling of zest.
The people of Pylos greeted them with cheer,
Their hospitality truly sincere.

But little did Telemachus know,
Athena was guiding him, ready to bestow
Wisdom and courage, and help him find
His father, who was lost to mankind.

Yo Telemachus, don't be shy or nervous,
Minerva wants us to be straight and purposeful,
We're on a quest and it's quite suspenseful,
To find out where your father's memory deserves.

Straight up to Nestor, we'll boldly go,
To inquire about the truth of our sorrow,
He'll spill the beans, that's for sure-o,
For he's an excellent person, no shade or borrow.

Beg him to speak truth, and nothing but the fact,
We won't tolerate any kind of act,
We're here for answers, not to overreact,
We'll leave no stone unturned, that's our pact.

So let's go, Telemachus, let's do this thing,
We'll find out the truth, that's what we bring,
We're on a mission, and we won't miss a string,
Let's vibe and see what Nestor will sing.

"Ayy, don't sweat it, T-mach," replied the Mentor with a grin,
"You gotta start somewhere, let the conversation begin.
Just be yourself, but show respect to the old man,
And don't forget to sprinkle some swag in your game plan.

Maybe start with a, 'What's good, my dude?'
Then show interest in his stories to set the mood.
Ask 'bout his past and his legendary feats,
And for sure, he'll spill the tea, no beats.

Remember to keep it light and keep it fun,
Throw in some memes, and you'll be his number one.
So go out there, Telemachus, and show what you've got,
And make memories with Nestor that can never be bought."

Oh, Telemachus, my dude,
Your instinct will guide you, it's true,
Heaven's on your side,
So just take it in stride.

The gods have been watching since birth,
You're destined for greatness, it's worth,
Trust yourself and your gut,
Don't let anyone tarnish your strut.

You got this, believe in yourself,
You'll conquer your battles with stealth,
The world is your oyster,
All you need is some moisture.

Like the gods that have guided you so,
Your success will continue to grow,
Just keep being true,
And you'll make it through.

It's like the meme says, "You've got this!" 
Your success will be lit, more than a fireworks blitz!

Telemachus was shook, this was wild,
Nestor was sitting with his homies in a huddle piled,
As they walked up, the crew greeted them with love,
Like they were blessings from the gods above.
Pisistratus dapped them up with his fist,
And they sat on sheepskins, definitely not missed.
The meat was cookin', the smell was so fly,
And Nestor's son poured them wine, they could die.
But the real kicker was Minerva, so iconic,
She got the golden cup first, and you know she'd bionic.

"Yo, dude, show some respect, 
It's King Neptune's feast we'll connect.
Before we raise our cup to sip, 
offer a prayer to let Neptune flip.
Your friend will do the same in kind, 
we can't survive without God in mankind.
I know he's young like me, 
but you're older, so let the priority be.
Pass the cup and let's get lit, 
with this righteous act, we commit."

Minerva sipped her tea, feeling like a queen
While praying to Neptune, her voice serene
Neptune, sweet Neptune, King of the sea
Listen to our prayers, and hear our plea
Bless Nestor and his sons, make their lives great
For the hecatomb they give, let them have a savory plate
Telemachus and I, we seek your favor
May our quest bring us happiness to savor

As Nestor spoke, the party was lit,
The guests were hyped and didn't want to quit.
They chowed down on meat that was roasted well,
Each plate emptied with a satisfied swell.

Telemachus and Penelope prayed,
Their gratefulness, they loudly conveyed.
Then they feasted on food with a hearty zest,
Every guest leaving feeling their best.

Nestor, knight of Gerene, spoke out loud,
His voice so clear, it captured the crowd.
With wisdom he spoke and stories to tell,
Everyone listened, they were under his spell.

Aye aye, sire, we're not here to cause any harm.
We're just some lit sailors, chillin' on the seas so calm.
We're not pirates, man, you gotta trust our vibe.
We're just a bunch of traders, trying to stay alive.
We've sailed from afar, from a port you might not know,
We're just tryna make some dough, you know how it goes, bro.
So what's your deal, man? You seem kinda tense,
Don't worry, we're not here to give you any offense.

Oh snap, Telemachus coming in brave,
Thanks to Minerva, he won't behave.
He's asking 'bout his dad, gotta know,
Making sure his name's not low.
Minerva's got his back so he won't crack,
Telemachus on the rise, that's a fact.

Yo Nestor, I'm here to ask
about Ulysses, a hero without a mask
We come from Ithaca, under Neritum's reign,
and his fate is shrouded, causing us great pain

He's said to have sacked the town of ancient Troy,
but his fate's hidden from us, no evidence to deploy
Did he fall in battle or lost at sea?
We need to know, please tell us truly

I'm begging you, please don't soften the truth,
just give it to me straight, like in your youth
If Ulysses had ever helped you out,
tell me now, don't leave me in doubt.

Oh dang, Nestor, your story has got me shook,
The Achaeans suffered so much, it's like history took
All the bad luck and threw it at them, dang
Ajax and Achilles fell, it sounds so insane!

But it wasn't just them, it was like all of them fell
Even your son, Antilochus, though he ran hella well
For nine long years, they tried every single thing
But heaven was like, "nope" and they couldn't win.

But yo, Nestor, did you say what I think you did?
That this dude's dad was like you, in every single way, kid?
No way, it's like too good to be true, I s2g
But you two sound the same, it's like blowing my mind, g.

It's lit though that you and pop had such a bond
The Argives needed good advice, and y'all never spawned
Any sort of beef, y'all were like a team, for real
And that's why you're telling his kid the deal.

Okay boomer, let me school you on this bummer
Back when we sacked Priam, it was lit like summer
Our ships were set to sail, feeling blessed with big hype
But Jove had plans to vex us, giving us a tough type

Not all Argives were wise, some just lacked understanding
Causing bad ends for many, so devastating
Daughter of Zeus, Minerva caused a quarrel to ensue
Between two brothers Atreus, girls and guys, it's not new 

But hey, we bounced back and fought with all our might
Winning battles left and right like we come out at night
So remember this lesson when you're feeling down
Keep pushing forward, because greatness can always be found.

Yo, check it homies - The Atreus' sons called a meeting like they should,  
But the Achaeans heavy with wine were in no mood to do any good.  
Menelaus peaced out, said he's going home,  
But Agamemnon was upset, saying we need to atone.  

Foolish Agamemnon thought we needed to appease Athena's wrath,  
But the goddess had already decided on her path.  
The two started to argue, slingin' harsh words with ease,  
The Achaeans jumped up, unsure which way to please.  

Should they follow Menelaus, and sail away?  
Or should they stay and try to appease Athena's stay?  
The tension was high, the air thick with emotion,  
It was anyone's guess what would be the final notion.

That night we were angry and vexed,
Jove planned mischief against us, no text.
Next morning some of us sailed the sea,
Women and goods aboard, sailing free.

Half stayed behind with Agamemnon,
And the other half set our sails on.
We offered sacrifices to the gods on Tenedos shore,
Longing to get home, but there was more.

Cruel Jove raised another quarrel,
Some turned back, while we kept morale.
We pressed forward with Tydeus' son,
And his crew, adventurous and never undone.

Menelaus joined us at Lesbos island,
Making up our minds about our sailing stand.
Either outside Chios or inside,
We asked for a sign, to the gods we confide.

The sign showed us the way to Euboea,
We sailed across the open sea with zeal, no fear.
And a fair wind sprang up,
Quick passage during the night, no hiccup.

Four days later, Diomed stationed in Argos,
But I held on for Pylos, braving the sea's blows.
The wind kept fair since heaven's first favor,
Reaching home faster, to our life's savior.

Yo, young blood, I'm back to tell ya
About the peeps who made it and those in a coma
I've got no news on the folks that we miss
But let me share what's the gist

They say Neoptolemus, son of Achilles
Managed to return to Greece without any glitches
Philotetes, the brave son of Poias
Also made it back without any hitches

Idomeneus didn't lose anyone at sea
All his followers survived by his decree
And as for Agamemnon, you know, the king?
His tale's no mystery or hidden thing

Aegisthus, with blood on his hands
Paid for his evil and met his end
Orestes avenged his father's dread
Killed the traitor and left him dead

So listen up, young gun, and make it soar
Be like Orestes and leave your mark for sure!

Yo Nestor, my homie so cool,
Telemachus is no fool.
He wants to avenge his dad,
Just like Orestes, that's rad!

The suitors are causing him strife,
Plotting and causing him such life.
But heaven won't grant his request,
So he'll bear it, that's the test.

But let's hope someday he'll get his way,
And the suitors will have to pay.
Until then, we'll cheer him on,
And hope his journey won't be long.

"Yo, my dude," said Nestor full of clout,

"I heard through the grapevine you're dealing with some doubt.

Your mom's got suitors making a mess,

Destroying your estate, causing stress.

Do you just take it or is there a fight,

Against these haters who think they're tight?

Who knows, maybe Ulysses will return,

And these fools will get what they've earned.

Minerva liked your dad back in Troy,

She kept him safe and acted like his joy,

If she can protect you like she did him,

These suitors will forget their whims."

Oh man, Telemachus, don't be a bummer,
You gotta manifest that good summer,
Let the good vibes flow and don't be a drag,
Like a Hogwarts house elf, you gotta have swag.

I get it, the odds ain't lookin' great,
But why give up and seal your own fate?
You gotta believe and shoot for the stars,
Even when life hits you hard like a thousand cigars.

The gods might be willing to lend a hand,
But it's up to you to make your stand,
Don't be a victim of your own self-doubt,
Flex your confidence and let it all out.

Like memes and slang, life's full of surprises,
So live it up and don't be afraid to improvise,
You got this, Telemachus, just keep pushing through,
And the universe will reward you with blessings anew.

Oh snap, Telemachus, what's the deal?
You really think that coming home is no big steal?
But listen up fam, don't be so quick to jet,
Heaven's got a long arm if it wants to protect.

If I was in your shoes, I wouldn't care how long it takes,
I just want to be safe, protected by the fates.
I'd rather not rush and get to my own zone,
Just to get killed by the treachery at home.

As Agamemnon once faced, back in the day,
Aegisthus and his wife causing great dismay.
Death freaking sucks, but it's a certainty,
Even if the gods love you abundantly.

"Yo, Telemachus, let's switch gears, let's talk about the tears. Your dad might be gone, but let's not think about that con. Nestor's got the scoop, he's like a cool immortal loop. Agamemnon's death was whack, Menelaus was off track. Aegisthus was a fake, but he decided to take, Agamemnon's reign, thinking he'd have no more pain. But Menelaus was out, maybe on his surfing route, Aegisthus took the chance, thinking he'd have a better dance. But karma's a boomerang, and Aegisthus got the bang."

Listen up, I'll give you the true scoop,
Nestor's words will make you wanna whoop!
As Menelaus returned from a war so grand,
Aegisthus in his house did make his stand.
No tomb or mourning would be his reward,
For his wicked deed made him a discord.
But we were overseas, putting up a great fight,
While back in Argos, Aegisthus had delight.
He sweet-talked Clytemnestra with endless glee,
And that's how things went down, you see? 
Like the 'thirsty' guys in your DMs,
Aegisthus pulled out all the gems.

This tale's got drama like it's straight from a show,
Agamemnon's wife had feelings, but we all know,
Her man was off to Troy, so he left a bard in charge,
To keep an eye on things, and make sure she wasn't at large. 

But Aegisthus had plans, his scheme was pretty wicked,
He sent the bard away and the plan got quickly thickened, 
And when the gods intervened to choose her fate,
She went over to Aegisthus' house, their bond sealed by his bait. 

He offered up some burnt sacrifices to the gods above,
And decorated temples, his plan fitting like a glove,
His success exceeded all of his wildest dreams,
A victory so sweet, it sent shivers running down his seams.

Yo, let me hype up this Greek myth,
About Menelaus and his epic journey forthwith,
After the Trojan War, he was on his way home,
But Apollo's arrow made his steersman's fate roam.

Phrontis, the skilled guy he lost so soon,
Aye, the sea was violent, that day's no moon,
So Menelaus had to halt and pay respects,
A true bro of a captain, his loyalty perfects.

When the coast cleared, he set sail again,
But it wasn't long before his luck turned vain,
Jove, the king of gods, had other plans,
And he stirred the waves, with his mighty hands.

The fleet was split, half went towards Crete,
The Cydonians they were about to meet,
The rest went towards a headland hella high,
Where the rocks were sharp, and the waves went awry.

Ships were wrecked, the crew barely survived,
The other boats went to Egypt, Menelaus thrived,
He collected gold and riches of alien speech,
While at home, Aegisthus plotted and did breach.

He ruled Mycene for seven years with pride,
The people were obedient under his guide,
But in the eighth year, Orestes stopped by,
To make bad Aegisthus pay and die.

Orestes, a noble lad, did his folks proud,
He hosted a banquet and made his family proud,
And that very day, Menelaus came back,
With tons of treasure, his voyages never slack.

Yo Listen up, homes, it's time to wise up,
Leaving home with those guys, better rise up,
They'll eat up everything, turning tides up,
Your property would be gone, I don't need to remind up. 

But let me tell you, there’s still hope,
Menelaus, who with distant peoples has had to cope,
Worse than crossing a banana-peel-covered slope,
His voyage was so far, it’ll make you mope.

Travelling by sea with your own men,
In a chariot with horses, if that's your yen,
My sons, Lacedaemon, will be your den,
Menelaus will tell the truth, for he's no pretend. 

He's an excellent person, straight-up shot caller,
His word’s his bond, not like trust fund baller,
So take my advice, don't even bother,
Just head to Menelaus, he's the one to holler. 

And don't forget, when you're at your wit's end,
Just remember "Ight Imma head out," like Spongebob's friend,
For traveling to Menelaus, there’s no need to pretend,
Your journey will be lit, homie, have fun until the end!

'Did you just say it's time for bed, oh Goddess of wisdom?'
'Before that, let's pour some wine and cut tongues with precision.'
'We'll make our offerings to Neptune and the gods up above.'
'And then, my dude, it's time for us to call it a night and get some love.'
 'As much as I'd love to stay up and chill,' Odysseus said with a frown.
'I need my beauty sleep, so let's wrap this up and wind down.'
'Thanks for the advice, Minerva, you truly are the best.'
'Now, let's cut some tongues and make some offerings, aight, let's give it our best.'

Yo, hold up, stop right there, Nestor's got something to share. 
He caught up to Telemachus and Athena, giving them quite a scare. 
After they made their offerings and drank their fill, 
Nestor had some wisdom to spill. 

"Stay a bit longer, my guests, I insist, 
There's something important that you don't wanna miss. 
I heard you mention Odysseus, the great friend of mine,
Let's talk about him and share some wine. 

You see, I know a lot about that fabled man, 
He was a hero like no other, with an epic plan. 
But now he's gone, and no one knows where he may be, 
It's been years since he set sail, tragedy after tragedy." 

Telemachus listened intently, wondering what he might learn, 
He wanted answers about his father, for whom he had so much yearn. 
Athena, too, was curious, her mind sharp and bright,
She wanted to know more about the great Odysseus' plight.

So they stayed a bit longer, to hear Nestor's tale,
To learn about Odysseus and his epic, heroic tale.

Bro, hold up, he said with a shout
Do you really wanna leave and sail about?
Do you think I'm so broke, so tight on cash?
That I can't provide you with a cozy stash?

Let me tell you, I have loads of rugs and clothes,
Enough for me, my fam, and all my bros.
No way, my dude, will you sleep on a boat,
Not while I'm alive, no way, no joke!

My sons will follow, that's the way we roll,
We'll keep open house, we're on a roll!
So c'mon and chill, don't be in a hurry,
We're all homies here, no need to worry!
