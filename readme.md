# The Odysslay
### Homer's Odyssey rewritten in Gen-Z speak (by ChatGPT)

This project is intended not as something worth reading, but more of as a statement on what the future of education might look like. The cost of mass-produced text is heading straight for zero, so hopefully we can leverage it to improve communications with people different than ourselves. All 19,000 rhyming lines cost less than $1 and took about a little over an hour to generate.

The final product is far from perfect, but there are definitely some funny bits.
```
This tale's got drama, it's got suspense
It's got more twists than a TikTok dance
I'm talkin' plot twists that'll leave you reeling
Like finding out your crush is actually a ceiling
```
```
Yo, hit up the crib and slay the fattest swine,
While I flex on my pops with this drip so fine.
Will he recognize me after all this time?
Or will his memory be as washed up as Vine?
```
```
Aye, Dolius, my dude, I'm back on my grind
And it feels so lit to be home and unwind
```
```
Two hounds by his side, he walks with swag,
The way he looks, it makes the people gag.
```
```
Until then, our boy's feeling blue,
Just like the meme says, "Feels bad, man," it's true.
```

Fortnite is mentioned 9 times.
```
Telemachus is ready to fight,
like he's still alive in Fortnite.
```

ChatGPT LOVES putting in hashtags if you mention twitter in your context prompt. I tried to explicitly negate them, but some still slipped through.

I considered proofreading The Odysslay and making a hard copy (because I think that would be hilarious), but after getting through Book I, I decided that there are far better things for me to spend my time on. It is definitely a far better starting point than beginning from scratch, but there is still considerable work to be done. Also, I feel like I would go insane editing 500 pages of AI generated verses about The Odyssey. 

The text (with proofread Book I) can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFDktTd9upkeeb21CR81_jIS-BcPYF4go_QovWKZXF4/edit?usp=sharing).
